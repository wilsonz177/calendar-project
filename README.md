# Calendar Website
Users are able to login/signup, and create user-specific events on their calendars. Users also have the option of sharing their calendars with other users if they  choose to. Users can also edit/delete their events. Events have tags, so that users can filter through events by tags, and you can edit/delete those tags as well.
